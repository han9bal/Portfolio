        <h3> Rudersdal Summer Concerts  </h3>
        <p> In august 2022, Leila Sherzai gave a concert at Søllerød Sognegård promoted by Rudersdal Summer Concerts. The concert was sold out long in advance, and she received standing ovations from an enthusiastic audience that included children and adults of all ages. The Ukrainian ambassador also attended the concert. It has been a huge enrichment to have Leila Shezai in the program for Rudersdal Summer Concerts and it will support our ambitions to make Rudersdal Summer Concerts  internationally recognised.<br> <br>Christine Pryn, Director Rudersdal Summer Concerts </p>
